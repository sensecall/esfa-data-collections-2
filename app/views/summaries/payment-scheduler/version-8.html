<h2 class="heading-medium">Clerical to system</h2>
<p>
  Have payments upto and including today been made?
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Changes made</h3>

<p>
  Changed the content asking the agent if they have made all of the clerical 
  payments to date. Changed from a Yes only style declaration to a Yes / No 
  question to see if it was easier to understand what to do if all the payments 
  aren't up to date.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Research notes</h3>
<p>
  Agents were audibly reading the question displayed to assess whether all of 
  the manual payments were up to date as a decision was required due to the 
  yes/no option presented. The previous yes only option caused agents to skim 
  over this question as no decision was required. The inclusion of instructions 
  to take if the payments weren't up to date ensured that agents were confident 
  as to what steps they should take before proceeding on BSP manager.
